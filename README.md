# Curse of the Dreamweaver
My Metroidvania video game currently being developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I started this project in my senior year at the University of South Carolina while enrolled in the MART 581-D, "Video Game Design" course.

# Playable Demo
You can play the current demo build of the game at: https://maxcorbel.itch.io/curse-of-the-dreamweaver-movement-demo-phase-one
I hope you enjoy and be sure to check in often as I am still developing the game further.
