# Curse of the Dreamweaver
My Metroidvania video game currently being developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I started this project in my senior year at the University of South Carolina while enrolled in the MART 581-D, "Video Game Design" course.

# Playable Demo
I am still in the process of determining whether or not GitHub is the right place to host the game's code as it is a rather large project. For now you can play the current demo build of the game at: https://maxcorbel.itch.io/curse-of-the-dreamweaver-movement-demo-phase-one
I hope you enjoy and be sure to check in often as the game is still in development and I will be updating the link with new demo builds when available.
